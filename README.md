I realized in the final hour finishing up my CSS that I didn't use my router.jsx file I had created. I instead permissioned routes as I went, mainly within files themselves and filtering with rendering. I totally recognize that I will probably lose points on some things :) I tried to implement as much as I could. A few of the common components were also not used/created as well, simply because I just implemented them as I went and forgot to create a common component until it was too late.

In terms of contexts, I ended up doing an AuthProvider, as well as providers for announcements and modules. I did this because I was having trouble getting the state to work for both of these pages and my announcements and modules would disappear as soon as I navigated away. I made hooks for useAuth and useModules in conjuction with those.

I also let my time get away from me and thus my canvas looks janky like its from the 2000s. consider it nostalgic, I think next time I will definitely have better time management regarding this. I definitely wanted to focus more on functionality, but I do recognize that this is a front-end class and I should have implemented the CSS better than what I was able to throw together.
